        <h5>The Project Gutenberg eBook of Tartuffe, by Jean-Baptiste Poquelin
                Moliere, Translated by Jeffrey D. Hoeper</h5>
        <h6>SCENE I Damis, Dorine</h6>


        <h6 class="name Damis">Damis.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">May a bolt of lightning now strike me dumb,
                May everybody treat me like a bum
                If either respect or force can hinder me
                From blowing my top at this calamity!</p>
        <h6 class="name Dorine">Dorine.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">For heaven's sake, control your displeasure.
                Your father has merely mentioned this measure.
                No one does everything he proposes.
                How something opens may not be how it closes.</p>
        <h6 class="name Damis">Damis. </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">I need to stop this vulgar coxcomb's plot
                And in two little words tell him what's what.</p>
        <h6 class="name Dorine">Dorine. </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">Whoa now! Why don't you let your step-mother
                Manage him just as she does your father.
                Over Tartuffe she has her own little ways
                Of making him welcome all that she says,
                And perhaps she makes his heart go pitter-patter.
                Pray God it's true! That would be a fine matter.
                In fact she has summoned him for your sake
                In order to learn exactly what's at stake,
                To find out his feelings, and to let him know
                What really rotten results would flow
                From any pretensions he might have to marry.
                His valet says he's praying, and I should tarry--
                That he'll descend after he meditates.
                Be off then, I beg you, and let me wait.</p>
        <h6 class="name Damis">Damis.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">I demand to be here the whole time they meet.</p>
        <h6 class="name Dorine">Dorine.
        </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> No. They must be alone.</p>
        <h6 class="name Damis">Damis.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> I won't even speak.</p>
        <h6 class="name Dorine">Dorine.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> You're kidding yourself. You're so quick to anger,
                And that would surely put us all in danger.
                Go.</p>
        <h6 class="name Damis">Damis. </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> No. I'm going to watch--without getting cross.</p>
        <h6 class="name Dorine">Dorine. </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">How tiresome you are! Here they come. Get lost!</p>
